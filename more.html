					<h3>---All About Myself---</h3>
					<p class="int">So hello everyone, let me say some things about me. Let me give 
					you a glimpse about myself. I will begin with my personality, I love being a positive
					thinker. Helping my friends and family without expecting anything in return is just 
					like an accomplishment in my part and I love doing it. I do value friendship. I don't 
					believe in saying, "Blood is Thicker than Water" instead, "Feelings is more Stronger
					than Emotions." I really love travelling around the world and soon in the future I will
					make sure to do that. My happiness is like the happiness of people around me, whom I love.
					Watching movies and dramas serves as my stress reliever. Doing whatever makes me happy
					is a great fullfillment in my part. I respect myself more than anyone because respect 
					comes from yourself before other and I think that's beautiful. I never let others take me down
					I stand on my own, I do ask help if needed. I have dignity and my own voice to express my 
					thoughts and opinion without hurting anyone. I stand on my principle and perspective but I still 
					know how to listen to others. I have my own ways to make people happy and feel better and above all 
					I love myself.</p>
